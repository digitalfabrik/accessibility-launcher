Carikom is a free open-source Android homescreen app designed to improve accessibility for people with cognitive
disabilities. The app features adjustable display sizes and explanatory texts that make it easy to navigate for people
of all abilities.

## Technologies Used

We opted for native Android since it is the only popular mobile OS that supports custom homescreens with launchers. We
use Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, which makes the app easy to extend and maintain.

## Download

You can download Carikom on Google Play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tuerantuer.launcher).
Please note that the app is currently only available in German.

## Support
